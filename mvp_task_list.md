# FiloSign MVP Task List

## Phase 1: MVP with Local Storage (Current Priority) 🎯

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Remove web3.storage dependencies** - COMPLETED
   - Removed @web3-storage/upload-client and @web3-storage/w3up-client
   - Updated filecoin-storage-service.ts to remove web3.storage imports
   - Fixed dependency conflicts

2. **Create Local Storage Interface** - COMPLETED
   - Built `local-storage-interface.ts` as replaceable storage abstraction
   - Implements same API as PDP storage for easy swapping
   - Uses existing hybrid encryption service
   - Provides upload, retrieval, and metadata operations

3. **Create Local Storage Upload Hook** - COMPLETED
   - Built `use-upload-local.ts` to replace `use-upload-pdp.ts`
   - Maintains same interface for easy component integration
   - Handles wallet connection via wagmi
   - Provides progress tracking and phase updates

4. **Update Send Page for Local Storage** - COMPLETED
   - Replaced PDP upload logic with local storage workflow
   - Updated UI to show "Local Storage (MVP)" instead of PDP
   - Simplified error handling for local storage
   - Updated success messages and status indicators

### 🔄 In Progress
5. **Fix dark mode text contrast** - IN PROGRESS
   - Server running at http://localhost:3000
   - CSS changes implemented for better accessibility
   - Needs user testing to verify readability

### 📋 Next Tasks
6. **Test complete encryption workflow**
   - Alice uploads document → encrypts for both parties → stores locally
   - Alice shares retrieval ID with Bob
   - Bob enters retrieval ID → decrypts → downloads document
   - Verify encryption works for both sender and recipient

7. **Update Receive Page for Local Storage**
   - Replace any PDP dependencies with local storage interface
   - Test document retrieval and decryption workflow
   - Ensure UI shows local storage status

8. **Verify UX flow matches PRD requirements**
   - Wallet connection and public key setup
   - Document upload with recipient address
   - Encryption for both sender and recipient
   - Retrieval ID generation and sharing
   - Document decryption and download

## Phase 2: PDP Integration (Separate Agent) 🔄

### 📋 Delegated Tasks
9. **PDP contract integration** - DELEGATED TO OTHER AGENT
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Contract deployment and interaction
   - Replace local storage interface with PDP storage
   - Maintain same API for seamless transition

10. **Production deployment preparation** - DELEGATED TO OTHER AGENT
    - Vercel deployment with PDP backend
    - Environment variable setup for production
    - Testing with real Filecoin storage

## Phase 3: Polish & Testing 📝

### 📋 Future Tasks
11. **End-to-end testing**
    - Complete workflow testing with multiple users
    - Error handling and edge cases
    - Performance optimization

12. **UI/UX refinements**
    - Dark mode polish and accessibility improvements
    - Mobile responsiveness
    - Loading states and animations

13. **Documentation updates**
    - Update README with local storage setup
    - Document API interfaces for PDP transition
    - User guide for testing workflow

## Current Status 📊

**✅ Ready for Testing:**
- Dark mode toggle (needs verification)
- Local storage upload workflow
- Wallet connection via wagmi
- Basic encryption/decryption flow

**🧪 Can Test Now:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Connect wallet (MetaMask required)
3. Upload PDF document
4. Specify recipient address
5. Generate retrieval ID
6. Test document retrieval (receive page)

**🚫 Not Ready:**
- PDP storage integration
- Production deployment
- Real Filecoin storage

## Architecture Notes 🏗️

### Replaceable Storage Interface
The local storage implementation uses the same interface as PDP storage:
- `StorageUploadOptions` - Upload parameters
- `StorageUploadResult` - Upload response
- `StorageRetrievalResult` - Retrieval response

This allows seamless transition from local storage to PDP without changing component code.

### Key Files
- `src/lib/services/local-storage-interface.ts` - Storage abstraction
- `src/lib/hooks/use-upload-local.ts` - Local storage upload hook
- `src/app/send/page.tsx` - Updated to use local storage
- `src/app/receive/page.tsx` - Needs update for local storage

### Environment Variables
Currently using wagmi for wallet connection. No additional environment variables needed for local storage MVP.
