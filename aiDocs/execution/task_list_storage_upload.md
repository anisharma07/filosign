# Storage Upload Flow - Task List

## Project Overview
Implementing the core storage upload flow for FiloSign, enabling users to upload documents to Filecoin PDP with direct wallet payment, receive retrieval IDs, and share documents securely. This focuses on the non-encrypted document sharing workflow as defined in the PRD.

## Instructions for the Agent
Before starting, review the `engineering_design_storage_upload.md` document to understand the layered architecture and storage abstraction patterns. Also review `prd-filosign.md` for the complete user flow requirements.
