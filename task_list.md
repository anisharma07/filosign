# FiloSign dApp Development Task List

## Project Overview
Building a privacy-preserving document encryption dApp with full SaaS UX flow. Focus on cryptographic access control without storing wallet addresses or metadata on-chain. Uses hybrid encryption (AES + ECIES) with MetaMask key management for secure document sharing.

## Instructions for the Agent
Before starting, review the `engineering_design.md` document to understand the privacy-preserving technical implementation details. Also review `prd-encryption.md` for product requirements and user experience goals.

As you complete each item, check-off each task: `[x]`

## Execution Notes:
When you complete a series of tasks or an update directly from the User chat, create a markdown file that goes in the `execution` folder.

This should provide more details around what was done.  Ideally, for each milestone, you should provide the details of the tasks, design decisions, and key code sign patterns.

## Key Strategy Notes:
- **Privacy-First**: No wallet addresses or metadata stored on-chain - pure cryptographic access control
- **Hybrid Encryption**: AES for documents, ECIES for key exchange, MetaMask for key management
- **Local Testing**: Complete encryption workflow with local storage before PDP integration
- **Vercel-Native**: Deploy early and often, optimize for Vercel from day one
- **PDF.js Focus**: Rich document preview and interaction without external dependencies
- **User-Centric**: Seamless wallet integration with one-time encryption key setup
