## Current Status: ðŸŽ¯
**Phase 1 - Project Setup & Vercel-Ready Foundation**

## Key Strategy Notes:
- **Mock-First Approach**: Complete SaaS UX with local storage before any blockchain integration
- **Vercel-Native**: Deploy early and often, optimize for Vercel from day one
- **PDF.js Focus**: Rich document preview and interaction without external dependencies
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with mocks, gradually replace with real backend
- **User-Centric**: Prioritize complete user workflows over technical implementation
- **Production-Ready**: Each phase should result in a deployable, testable product
