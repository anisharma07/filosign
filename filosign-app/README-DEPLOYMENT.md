# FiloSign SaaS App - Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **MVP Status: Ready for Testing**

The FiloSign SaaS app has been built with a complete mock-first approach as specified in your requirements. Here's what's implemented:

## âœ… **Completed Features**

### **Core Functionality**
- âœ… **Modern SaaS Landing Page** - Vercel-style clean design
- âœ… **Mock Wallet Connection** - Simulates MetaMask without real Web3
- âœ… **Send Document Flow** - Upload PDF, specify recipient, get Retrieval ID
- âœ… **Receive Document Flow** - Enter Retrieval ID, preview, sign document
- âœ… **Signed Documents Dashboard** - Shows sent/received documents with status
- âœ… **Mock Storage System** - Local storage for testing complete workflows

### **UX Implementation (Per Your Answers)**
- âœ… **Simplified PDF Preview** - Placeholder for PDF.js (can be enhanced)
- âœ… **MetaMask Signature Flow** - Direct popup with explanatory text
- âœ… **Automatic Wallet Verification** - Checks recipient address matches
- âœ… **Error Handling** - User-friendly messages with retry options
- âœ… **Absolute Date Format** - MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PM display
- âœ… **Single Document per Retrieval ID** - Simplified for MVP
- âœ… **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly (inherited from UI framework)

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: Manual Vercel Deployment (Recommended)**
1. **Push to GitHub**: Create a new repository and push the `filosign-app` folder
2. **Connect to Vercel**: Import the repository in your Vercel dashboard
3. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy

### **Option 2: Vercel CLI with Token**
If you provide a Vercel token, I can deploy directly using:
```bash
npx vercel --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

## ðŸ§ª **Local Testing Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn

### **Setup & Run**
```bash
cd filosign-app
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

**Note**: There seems to be a development server issue, but the build works perfectly. You can test the built version with `npm run start`.

## ðŸ“± **Testing the Complete Flow**

### **Test Scenario 1: Send Document**
1. Visit the app
2. Click "Connect Wallet" (uses mock user Alice Johnson)
3. Click "Send Document"
4. Upload a PDF file
5. Select recipient (Bob Smith or Carol Davis)
6. Click "Sign and Secure"
7. Copy the generated Retrieval ID (format: FS-XXXXXXXX)

### **Test Scenario 2: Receive Document**
1. Disconnect wallet and reconnect as different user
2. Click "Sign Received Document"
3. Enter the Retrieval ID from step 1
4. Click "Retrieve Document"
5. Review the document preview
6. Click "Sign Document"
7. See success confirmation

### **Test Scenario 3: View Signed Documents**
1. Return to dashboard
2. See "Signed Documents" section with:
   - Documents sent (with status)
   - Documents received (with status)
   - Timestamps and recipient/sender info

## ðŸ”§ **Environment Variables Needed**

Create `.env.local` file:
```
# For future Web3 integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key

# For production deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps for Real Backend Integration**

The app is designed for easy migration from mocks to real backend:

1. **Replace Mock Storage** â†’ IPFS/Filecoin PDP integration
2. **Replace Mock Wallet** â†’ Real MetaMask with Wagmi
3. **Replace Mock Encryption** â†’ Real cryptographic signing
4. **Add Smart Contracts** â†’ Deploy and integrate Filecoin contracts

## ðŸŽ¨ **Design & UX Notes**

- **Clean, modern SaaS design** inspired by Vercel
- **Simplified functionality** as requested (no complex features)
- **Mobile responsive** (inherited from shadcn/ui)
- **Error handling** with clear user feedback
- **Loading states** for better UX

## ðŸ”’ **Security for Remote Agent Deployment**

For secure deployment with remote agents:

1. **Create temporary Vercel token** with limited scope
2. **Set expiration** for 24-48 hours
3. **Revoke immediately** after deployment
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data

Would you like me to proceed with deployment once you provide the token, or would you prefer to deploy manually using the GitHub â†’ Vercel workflow?
