# Wallet Integration Fix

## Issue Resolved

The user reported that the send page was displaying mock user data ("ABC DEFGH 0x123...7890") instead of the actual connected wallet address. This was happening because the application was using a mock storage system for user management instead of the real wallet connection from Wagmi.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Send Page (`/src/app/send/page.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Used `MockUser` type and mock storage for current user
- Displayed mock user name and address in header
- Required mock user selection before accessing the page

**After:**
- Uses `useAccount` hook from Wagmi to get real wallet connection
- Displays actual connected wallet address in header
- Shows wallet connection interface if wallet is not connected
- Uses real wallet address for document operations

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Old approach
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState<MockUser | null>(null);
useEffect(() => {
  const user = mockStorage.getCurrentUser();
  setCurrentUser(user);
}, []);

// New approach
const { address, isConnected } = useAccount();
const [userPublicKey, setUserPublicKey] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### 2. Updated Receive Page (`/src/app/receive/page.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Used mock user system for wallet verification
- Required mock user to be set before accessing

**After:**
- Uses real wallet connection from Wagmi
- Shows wallet connection interface if not connected
- Uses actual wallet address for document verification

### 3. Enhanced Wallet Connection Component (`/src/components/wallet-connection.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Showed abbreviated public key with basic success message

**After:**
- Displays full public key in a formatted code block
- Shows clear "✅ SUCCESS: Public Key Extracted!" message
- Better visual formatting with proper spacing and styling

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Real Wallet Integration
- **Header Display**: Now shows the actual connected wallet address instead of mock data
- **Wallet Verification**: Uses real wallet address for document encryption/decryption
- **Seamless Flow**: No need to manually select mock users

### 2. Better Public Key Display
- **Success Message**: Clear indication when public key extraction succeeds
- **Full Key Display**: Shows complete public key for verification
- **Professional Styling**: Proper code formatting and visual hierarchy

### 3. Improved Navigation
- **Wallet Connection Required**: Pages now require actual wallet connection
- **Clear Instructions**: Users are guided to connect their wallet if not connected
- **Consistent Experience**: Same wallet connection flow across all pages

## Technical Implementation

### Wallet Connection Flow
1. User navigates to send/receive page
2. If wallet not connected, shows connection interface
3. User connects wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
4. Public key is discovered via signature
5. Real wallet address is displayed in header
6. User can proceed with document operations

### Public Key Extraction
1. User clicks "Setup Encryption Key"
2. Wallet prompts for message signature
3. Public key is extracted from signature using viem
4. Success message and full public key are displayed
5. Public key is cached for future use

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/app/send/page.tsx`** - Updated to use real wallet connection
2. **`/src/app/receive/page.tsx`** - Updated to use real wallet connection  
3. **`/src/components/wallet-connection.tsx`** - Enhanced public key display

## Testing

The application now correctly:
- ✅ Shows real wallet address in headers
- ✅ Requires actual wallet connection for send/receive flows
- ✅ Displays full public key with success message
- ✅ Uses real wallet address for document operations
- ✅ Provides clear wallet connection interface when needed

## Next Steps

1. **ENS Integration**: Could add ENS name resolution for better user display
2. **User Profiles**: Could allow users to set display names
3. **Multi-Wallet Support**: Could support multiple wallet types
4. **Address Book**: Could add recipient address management

The core issue has been resolved - the application now properly displays and uses the actual connected wallet address instead of mock data.
