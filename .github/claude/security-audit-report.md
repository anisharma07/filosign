# üîí Security & Code Quality Audit Report

**Repository:** anisharma07/filosign  
**Audit Date:** 2025-07-30 20:09:19  
**Scope:** Comprehensive security and code quality analysis

## üìä Executive Summary

The audit of the filosign repository reveals a moderate security risk profile with 7 static analysis findings and 6 outdated dependencies. The project is a TypeScript-based decentralized document signing application with 57,732 lines of code across 93 files. While the core application shows no critical runtime vulnerabilities, there are significant GitHub Actions security issues that could allow command injection attacks.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical Issues:** 2 (Command injection vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions)
- **Major Issues:** 5 (Additional Semgrep findings requiring analysis)
- **Minor Issues:** 6 (Retired/outdated dependencies)
- **Overall Risk Level:** **Medium-High**

The primary concerns center around CI/CD security and dependency management. The TypeScript codebase appears well-structured with proper encryption services and wallet integration, but immediate action is required on the GitHub Actions vulnerabilities.

## üö® Critical Security Issues

### 1. GitHub Actions Command Injection Vulnerability

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Security - Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Description:** Two GitHub Actions workflows contain shell injection vulnerabilities where untrusted `github` context data is used directly in `run:` steps without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious commands through PR titles, commit messages, or other user-controlled GitHub context variables.
- **Impact:** Full compromise of GitHub Actions runners, potential theft of repository secrets, unauthorized code execution, and supply chain attacks
- **Location:** 
  - `.github/workflows/claude-audit.yml` (lines 829-848)
  - `.github/workflows/claude-generate.yml` (lines 64-81)
- **Remediation:** 
  1. Replace direct `${{ github.* }}` interpolation with environment variables
  2. Use the `env:` block to safely pass GitHub context data
  3. Always quote environment variables in shell scripts: `"$ENVVAR"`
  
  **Example Fix:**
  ```yaml
  # Instead of:
  run: echo ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  
  # Use:
  env:
    PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: echo "$PR_TITLE"
  ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Issues

### 1. Incomplete Semgrep Analysis Data

- **Severity:** Major
- **Category:** Security Analysis
- **Description:** The Semgrep report appears truncated, showing only partial results. The JSON output cuts off mid-analysis, indicating potential issues with the scanning process or data collection.
- **Impact:** Unknown security vulnerabilities may exist but are not visible in this audit
- **Location:** Semgrep analysis results
- **Remediation:** Re-run complete Semgrep analysis with full output capture and review all findings

### 2. Missing Security Headers Analysis

- **Severity:** Major  
- **Category:** Web Security
- **Description:** No analysis of security headers, CORS policies, or web-specific security configurations for the React application
- **Impact:** Potential XSS, clickjacking, and other web-based attacks
- **Location:** Web application configuration
- **Remediation:** Implement comprehensive security header analysis and configure appropriate CSP, HSTS, and other security headers

### 3. Cryptocurrency Wallet Security Review Required

- **Severity:** Major
- **Category:** Cryptographic Security
- **Description:** The application handles wallet connections and cryptographic operations but lacks specialized security review for blockchain-specific vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Potential loss of user funds or private key exposure
- **Location:** `wagmi-config.ts`, wallet integration components
- **Remediation:** Conduct specialized smart contract and wallet security audit

### 4. Encryption Implementation Review Needed

- **Severity:** Major
- **Category:** Cryptographic Security  
- **Description:** Custom hybrid encryption service requires expert cryptographic review to ensure proper implementation
- **Impact:** Potential data exposure through cryptographic weaknesses
- **Location:** `hybrid-encryption-service.ts`
- **Remediation:** Expert cryptographic review of encryption implementation and key management

### 5. Public Key Discovery Security

- **Severity:** Major
- **Category:** Authentication Security
- **Description:** Public key discovery mechanism may be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks
- **Impact:** Authentication bypass or key substitution attacks
- **Location:** `public-key-service.ts`
- **Remediation:** Implement public key pinning and verification mechanisms

## üîç Minor Issues & Improvements

### 1. Outdated Dependencies (6 identified)
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Category:** Dependency Management
- **Description:** Six retired or outdated dependencies detected by retire.js scan
- **Impact:** Potential exposure to known vulnerabilities in older library versions
- **Remediation:** Update all dependencies to latest stable versions and establish regular dependency update schedule

### 2. Local Storage Security
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Category:** Data Storage
- **Description:** Sensitive document metadata stored in browser localStorage without additional security measures
- **Impact:** Data exposure in case of XSS or local system compromise
- **Location:** `local-storage-service.ts`
- **Remediation:** Consider encrypted storage or session-only storage for sensitive metadata

### 3. Error Handling Consistency
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Category:** Code Quality
- **Description:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- **Impact:** Potential information disclosure or poor user experience
- **Remediation:** Implement standardized error handling and logging framework

## üíÄ Dead Code Analysis

### Unused Dependencies
- **Status:** Analysis incomplete - depcheck returned empty results
- **Recommendation:** Run manual dependency analysis with tools like `npm-check-unused` or `bundle-analyzer`

### Unused Code
- **Large JSON files:** 16,765 lines of JSON code may include unused configuration or data
- **XML files:** 28,727 lines of XML require analysis for unused content
- **Recommendation:** Review large data files for unused content and consider code splitting

### Unused Imports
- **ESLint Status:** Clean - no unused imports detected
- **TypeScript:** Review 4,571 lines of TypeScript for potential optimization opportunities

## üîÑ Refactoring Suggestions
